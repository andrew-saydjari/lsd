# lsd -- Large Survey Database

This fork follows the installation developed by czucker which was located at https://tinyurl.com/lsd-for-gaia. The repo modernizes some of the source code to make it work with modern pytable and astropy distributions. The code is currently still python 2.7, but working off of this base to convert to python 3 might be fairly simple.
